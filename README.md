# storage

Random storage for scripts and random files.

## ImHex

### Patterns

To use these, place the whole `aoqia` folder into one of your imhex patterns folders.

- [Chromeengine Sound Bank](imhex/patterns/aoqia/csb.hexpat)
CSB files are used by ChromeEngine games to store multiple Fmod Sound Bank (FSB) files into one, stripping the name table as well. Some games that use it are:
  - Dead Island (CE5)
  - Dead Island: Riptide (CE5)
  - Dying Light (CE6)
- [Fmod Sound Bank](imhex/patterns/aoqia/fsb.hexpat)
FSB files are used by FMOD. This is a very basic pattern to get the point across for use in the CSB pattern.

## Scripts

- [vod-downloader](scripts/src/vod-downloader)
- [steam-collection-append](scripts/src/steam-collection-append)
- [zomboid-modlist-export](scripts/python/zomboid-modlist-export)
